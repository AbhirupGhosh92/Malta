# Malta
A testing framework on top of Appium, designed to be the icing on the cake
Malta is designed to help automation testers focus more on their test cases than before. All the configurations are taken care of by the framework.

Malta also provides with utility methods to reduce writing cubersome code(Currently only few such methods are provided but in time we will cook some more). 

Malta is built on top of Appium which is a popular automation testing tool used to test mobile apps. The core files are few pieces of code
which help the tester in writing test cases and plans. The tester sets all the configs in an XML file and Malta picks it up perfectly. Furthermore the plan can be deployed as a stanalone Jar using maven and can run on any platform. 

I hope people find it useful and contribute to the development of this project
